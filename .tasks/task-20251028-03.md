# Task 20251028-03: StreamingTranslator Failure Handling
Linked Spec: SPEC-TRANSLATION-001
Goal:
Introduce deterministic chunk generation, retry/skip policy, and richer logging for translation failures while keeping streaming model usage intact.

Steps:
- Amend translation spec to describe chunk generator algorithm, retry limits, and logging requirements.
- RED: craft tests covering chunk boundary calculations, retry exhaustion (mocked API errors), and summary metrics logging.
- GREEN: refactor `StreamingTranslator.translate` to use a generator for chunks, track chunk indexes, and retry configurable times before recording failures.
- Refactor: ensure `_translate_chunk` raises explicit exceptions for permanent failures to aid retry loop.
- Update documentation/spec tracing and add metrics to README or operational notes as needed.

DoD Checklist:
- [x] Spec extended with chunking/retry design and Trace metadata.
- [x] Tests fail prior to implementation (chunk generator + retry).
- [x] Implementation passes all tests and logs chunk outcomes.
- [x] Coverage for new branches achieved; negative paths asserted.
- [x] Operational docs/README mention retry behaviour & configuration knobs.

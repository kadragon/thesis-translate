    title: "Provide test-safe default OPENAI_API_KEY"
    completed_at: "2025-12-07T06:10:00Z"
    outcome: |
      Added a harmless default OPENAI_API_KEY for test runs via pytest conftest to prevent OpenAI client initialization failures when no secret is configured. Updated trace metadata to include this task and spec linkage.
    test_results: |
      ✓ uv run pytest (all 43 tests): 42 passed, 1 skipped
    estimated_effort: 0.3h
    actual_effort: 0.2h
    notes: |
      Change is test-only; production env values still override because setdefault preserves caller-provided secrets.

    title: "Implement parallel chunk translation"
    completed_at: "2025-12-07T01:00:00Z"
    outcome: |
      Successfully implemented parallel chunk translation to reduce translation time:

      - Modified StreamingTranslator to use ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing
      - Implemented _translate_parallel() for concurrent chunk processing
      - Preserved _translate_sequential() for backward compatibility (max_workers=1)
      - Ensured chunk order is preserved in output regardless of completion order
      - Removed file monitoring features (concurrent-translation, user-prompted-translation)
      - Deleted related source files, tests, and specs
      - Updated TextPreprocessor to remove orchestrator integration

    title: "User-Prompted Translation CLI Integration"
    completed_at: "2025-11-01T18:00:00Z"
    outcome: |
      Implemented user-prompted translation mode with manual triggering:
      - Modified FileWatcher to support auto_translate parameter (backward compatible)

      - Implemented manual trigger methods: is_translation_ready(), trigger_translation_manual(), get_current_threshold()
      - Added proxy methods to ConcurrentOrchestrator for CLI integration
      - Integrated TextPreprocessor with orchestrator for translation status display
      - Added 'T' key handler for manual translation triggering
      - Added exit confirmation when untranslated content exists
    test_results: |
      ✓ All tests pass (54 total: 48 original + 6 new)
      ✓ Coverage maintained above 85% threshold
      ✓ Linting passes with no violations
      ✓ Threshold progression works correctly (40k → 80k → 120k tokens)
      ✓ Manual trigger API tested and verified
    estimated_effort: 6h
    actual_effort: 5.5h

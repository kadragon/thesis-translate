# Task 20251117-01: Env-based Required Config
Linked Spec: SPEC-CONFIG-001
Goal:
Move translation settings out of hardcoded `src/config.py` into mandatory environment variables loaded from `.env`, raising runtime errors when missing.

Steps:
- Extend spec to require environment-backed configuration and validation errors on missing values.
- RED: add tests asserting missing env vars raise clear exception and values are read from env.
- GREEN: update config loading to read from env only (no default constants) and fail fast when absent.
- Update `.env.example` and trace annotations as needed.
- Document changes in governance memory.

DoD Checklist:
- [x] Spec updated with new AC and tracing
- [x] Tests cover env resolution and missing-var failure
- [x] Implementation uses env values exclusively and validates presence
- [x] `.env.example` lists new required keys
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] memory.md updated
- [x] Task status recorded
